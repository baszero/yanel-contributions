<h2>About</h2>
<p>
We want to make social networks open. Open networks mean communication without boundaries and lock-in.
</p>

<p>
The strategy is very simple: We will provide open social network server and client software for everyone such that everyone is empowered to become part of a decentralized network (just as email is today).
</p>

<p>Please find more information about the technical implementation at <a href="http://yanel.wyona.org/specification/foaf/index.html">http://yanel.wyona.org/specification/foaf/index.html</a>.
