<h2>About</h2>
<p>
We want to make social networks open. Open networks mean communication without boundaries and lock-in.
</p>

<p>
The strategy is very simple: We will provide open social network server and client software for everyone such that everyone is empowered to become part of a decentralized network (just as email is today).
</p>

<p>
In order to guarantee openness we have defined "The three laws of an open social network provider":
<ol>
  <li>An open social network provider must provide an export/migrate
button, which allows one to move his/her own data/profile completely to 
any other "open social network provider"</li>
  <li>An open social network provider must provide a delete button, which
allows one to delete his/her own data/profile completely</li>
  <li>An open social network provider must protect one's data/profile, as 
long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
</ol>

</p>
