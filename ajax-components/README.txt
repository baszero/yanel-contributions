  

  AJAX Components based on GWT (Google Web Toolkit)
  --------------------------------------------------

    0) Download and install Apache Ant
    1) Download GWT from http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html
    2) Copy build.properties to local.build.properties and reconfigure
          - the path to the downloaded (and unpacked) GWT package
          - the operating system specific gwt dev lib name
       within local.build.properties
    5) Start building components (e.g. change directory to upload and run ant. A build directory should be created.)
    6) Test components (e.g. open a browser and open one of the test files, for example" ..../ajax-components/upload/build/org.wyona.yanel.gwt.Upload/Upload.html)
