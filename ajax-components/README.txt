  

  AJAX Components based on GWT (Google Web Toolkit)
  --------------------------------------------------

    1) Download GWT from http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html
    2) Configure the path of the downloaded gwt package within build.properties
    3) Depending on the operating system one is using, the gwt dev lib needs to be configured within build.properties
    4) Download and install Apache Ant
    5) Start building components (e.g. change directory to upload and run ant. A build directory should be created.)
    6) Test components (e.g. open a browser and open a file such as for instance ..../ajax-components/upload/build/org.wyona.yanel.gwt.Upload/Upload.html)
