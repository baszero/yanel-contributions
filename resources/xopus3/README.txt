Download Xopus 3 from

http://xopus.com/download/

and unpack it within

htdocs

directory (for example htdocs/Xopus-3.2.10)

(or rather unpack within DIR/from-scratch-realm-template/data-repo/data/Xopus-3.2.10)

and change the version number within

htdocs/xslt/load-xopus-xhtml.xsl

Also add a favicon.ico to data-repo/data/Xopus-3.2.10/xopus/media/ because no such favicon exists and hence one receives 404 because one is referenced from within xopus.html
